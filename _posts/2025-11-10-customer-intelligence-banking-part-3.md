# 📊 Tableau Dashboard & Call to Action

As I started to build out the Tableau dashboard, it became clear that the **real value** in this project was not just generating SQL queries, but creating a **Visual Tool** that could be used by stakeholders to make better decisions in real-time: in other words, whoever finds numbers and graphs difficult to read and understand.


# ⚽ Main Goals

> Build and refine the **Tableau Dashboard**  
> Add filters and interactivity for better insights
> Implement **call-to-action** for customer retention  
> Focus on **Tier-1 customers** as they are the most valuable, and identifying the high-risk ones 

---

# 📋 Step by Step

📍 Step 1: Designed the **KPI Summary** tab, key metrics like loan portfolio size, average balance, and high utilization 
📍 Step 2: Built the **Customer Overview** tab, showing account balances and behaviors by **account type**  
📍 Step 3: Integrated a **Credit Card Health** tab to highlight customers above 80% utilization
📍 Step 4: Added the **Customer Value** bubble chart, to compare tier lists and net positions of each client  


# 🔑 Key Insights

> **Tier-1 customers** (high-value, low-risk) emerged as the main focus for retention.  
> These customers use credit more frequently, despite their negative balances, their income are safer for long-term profitability.  
> The dashboard visualizes this, allowing teams to focus on creating customised product and services for these clients.

# 🏆 Final Thoughts: The Other Side of the Dashboard

After being inside this project, I can say one thing: building dashboards and writing SQL queries was not easy, but the real challenge is understanding **what kind of world that data comes from**.

This dataset, as mentioned before, comes from the **U.S. banking market**, and you can feel it; why? Americans have a completely different relationship with money: **credit is not a danger**, it’s a tool: they borrow to invest and build; the debt, for them, is justified as part of growth.

In Europe (especially in Southern Europe) it’s the opposite story: **we save before spending**, we find it scary and dangerous.  

So while analyzing this dataset, I genuinely found myself thinking:

> “If these were European customers, half these behaviors would never appear.”

That’s the interesting part: the same SQL queries, the same segmentation logic, but a completely different **financial psychology** behind the numbers, a **context** that has to be understood.  

That's exactly the reason why I'm passionate about this work, because I start with columns, rows, queries and dashboard, and then I end up questioning **why people are doing this or that!!**

💬 *Next step?* Maybe I’ll rebuild this entire analysis using **European-style banking data**, to see what happens when “credit” becomes the exception, not the rule.
