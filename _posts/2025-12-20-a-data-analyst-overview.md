# ⏳ The Evolution: Late Summer to Now

Since August, I’ve measured my progress not in months, but in friction:
* Fighting with Jupyter vs. Terminal logic.
* Reviving an old laptop with Debian just to have a dedicated dev environment.
* Watching GitHub Actions fail until they finally didn't.

The goal was simple: **Stop living in static Excel formulas and start building reproducible data systems.** What followed was a messy, rewarding transition from "theory" to a portfolio grounded in reality.

# 🧱 The Build: Portfolio Highlights

### 1️⃣ Finance Foundations
Before pivoting to pure analytics, I built tools to automate the technical debt of finance:
* **Custody NAV Calculator:** Python-based automation for daily net asset values.
* **Portfolio Risk Report:** My first engine for wrapping complex logic into structured outputs.
* **Thesis Backtesting:** Testing ETF vs. SPX strategies using historical data.

### 2️⃣ iGaming & Behavioral Analytics
This was the shift from "rows of data" to "customer journeys."
* **Retention & Churn:** Built SQL logic to define cohorts and LTV.
* **Product Thinking:** Moving beyond `SELECT *` to answer questions about player engagement and risk.

### 3️⃣ Banking Customer Intelligence
I scaled a raw banking dataset from 5K to 100K records using Python, then architected a PostgreSQL schema to analyze it.
* **The Goal:** Identify high-value customers vs. churn risks.
* **The Result:** Professional Tableau dashboards built on structured schemas, not just "pivots."

### 4️⃣ Louisville Metro Public Payroll
My most ambitious project to date, using **40,000+ real-world salary records.**
* **The Tech:** PostgreSQL (Indexes, CTEs, Window Functions) + Tableau Public.
* **The Insight:** Mapped overtime intensity and pay inequality across five years of city data.
* **The Shift:** I stopped "inventing" companies and started solving problems with messy, public data.

# 🧭 What’s Next for 2026?

### Technical Depth
* **Statistical Modeling:** Implementing hypothesis testing, and logistic regression.
* **Python:** Moving from Notebooks to clean, scheduled ETL scripts.

### Freelance Projects
I am shifting toward **projects from clients**:
* **Business Dashboards:** Turning messy invoices into clear output.
* **Data Audits:** Templates for migrating business logic from "spreadsheet chaos" to structured databases.
