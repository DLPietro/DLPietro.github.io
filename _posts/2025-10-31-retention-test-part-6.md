# End: Dashboard & Final Insights

The iGaming Retention Test project is complete — from simulation to statistical validation, modeling, and visualization.


# Main Goals of the day:

- Build an interactive dashboard with **Plotly**  
- Combine retention, churn, and monetization visuals  
- Summarize key takeaways from all project phases  

# Step by Step

📍 Step 1: Connected SQL outputs to Python  
📍 Step 2: Built interactive retention/deposit charts  
📍 Step 3: Visualized churn probabilities across segments  
📍 Step 4: Published the final insights and GitHub repo  

# Insights
  
> ✅ **Dashboard for decision-makers realised.**

When a manager and technicians open the work:  
→ They see **A/B Test Results**  
→ They see **Effects between Control and Treatment groups**  
→ They see **Percentages for retention and churn probabilities** to act and prevent errors

*Retetion and Feature Usage percentages higher for the treatment group, and lower churn rate.*

# 🏆 Final Thought

> Clear comunications for decision-makers. Next steps will be cleaning and working with real-time datasets to be cleaned.

**That's all so far, folks!!**
