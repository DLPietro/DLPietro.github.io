## 🌟 I'm Pietro Di Leo — From repetitive tasks to cooler projects

Let's be honest: I did the “Standard Path” like the majority of people outside:
- University completed (Master’s in Quantitative Finance)
- Job in Finance obtained (3 years in custody operations)
- I did the work, met the deadlines, learned the rules...

...But after a while, I got restless.

## ❔ Why I've been planning something more

The stability of the role is not enough to compensate:
- **repetitive and manual tasks** — Excel without macros, PDF reports, scanning documents, endless copy-paste...
- My skills in statistics and modeling were **collecting dust**, as stuff piled up in the loft
- The tools date back to the Middle Ages

I realized this thing:  
**I'm not solving problems: I'm a cog in the machine!**

So I made a choice:  

# Stop waiting for the company to upskill me, I’d rather build my own path!!! 🔥🔥🔥

## 🚀 My Self-Driven Transition into Data

I've been learning, using, banging my head on:
- **Python** — why to use it, and how
- **SQL** — enough Excel, 1000 times better
- **Tableau** — to show insights USEFUL for clients
- **Git & GitHub** — to work like a real developer, not the guy who discovered Canva and said 'OMG, this is the future!!'


So, I've been building **Real Projects**:

- 🎰 **iGaming Retention Test** (Python, A/B test, Machine Learning) - _⚠️ IN PROGRESS!!!_
- 🎲 **Casino KPI Dashboard** (SQL, cohort analysis, dashboards)
- 📊 **NAV Calculator** using Python (Net Asset Value Formula automised) 
- 📈 **Portfolio Risk Report** in Python (computes Sharpe, CVaR, drawdowns)
- 💻 **Empirical Data analysis** - 10 yrs of time series comparing S&P 500, ETFs, and active funds (_R, GARCH, backtesting_)

This is NOT “Just learning and getting my certificate” — it’s **Gentlemen, that's the service I can do for you!!**.

## 💻 All very nice, but why Data?

Let's be real: I could keep doing the same job, year after year; however, I don’t want to trade my time for a salary that doesn’t reflect what I can deliver.

That's why I’m investing in these skills, because I believe my work — **real analysis, automation, insight generation** — has more value than manual processing, in a world where **impact is rewarded**, not just presence.

This isn’t just a career move: it’s about building an entire future where my effort, curiosity, and code are **recognized and fairly valued**.

I’m not trying to be a “rockstar data scientist”.  
I want to be a **pragmatic analyst** who:
- Understands the business
- Writes clean, useful code
- Turns questions into answers

## 😊 Let’s Talk

I’m based in Malta, fluent in English, Spanish, and Italian, and open to remote or EU-based roles in data analytics, BI, or fintech.

If you’re building a team that **doesn't beat around the bush**, I’d be happy to connect.
