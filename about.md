## 👋 Hi, I'm Domenico Pietro

I'm a finance professional transitioning into **data analytics**, with a background in **custody operations** and a **Master’s in Quantitative Finance**.

For the past few years, I've worked in operational roles where precision, compliance, and data accuracy were critical — but I always asked:  
> *"Can we automate this report?"*  
> *"What does this data tell us about performance?"*  
> *"How can we turn numbers into decisions?"*

That curiosity led me to start a **structured journey into data** — learning Python, SQL, and Tableau through hands-on projects that solve real-world problems.

## 📌 My Journey: From Operations to Data-Driven Insights

### 🏦 Finance & Custody Operations
I spent 3 years in custody operations, managing settlement processes and client reporting. This gave me a deep understanding of **financial data flows**, **regulatory requirements**, and the **importance of data integrity**.

But I wanted to go beyond execution — to **drive decisions**, not just support them.

### 📚 Master’s in Quantitative Finance
My academic background gave me a solid foundation in **risk modeling**, **statistical analysis**, and **financial markets** — skills I now apply to data problems.

### 🚀 Upskilling in Data
Now, I'm building practical expertise in:
- **Python**: for automation, analysis, and risk modeling
- **SQL**: for querying and transforming data
- **Tableau / Power BI**: for visualization and reporting
- **Git & GitHub**: for version control and open learning

Every project I build — from a portfolio risk calculator to a simulated iGaming analytics dashboard — is a step toward becoming a **data analyst who understands both the numbers and the business behind them**.
